# Cypress Fail Fast

Enables fail fast in Cypress, skipping the rest of tests on first failure.

## Installation

Add the plugin to `devDependencies`

```bash
npm i --save-dev cypress-fail-fast
```

Inside `cypress/plugins/index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require("cypress-fail-fast/plugin")(on, config);
  return config;
};
```

At the top of `cypress/support/index.js`:

```javascript
import "cypress-fail-fast";
```

From now, if one test fail after its last retry, the rest of tests will be skipped:

## Configuration

### Environment variables

* __`FAIL_FAST_ENABLED`__: `boolean = true` Allows disabling the "fail-fast" feature globally, but it could be still enabled for specific tests or describes using [configuration by test](#configuration-by-test).
* __`FAIL_FAST_PLUGIN`__: `boolean = true` If `false`, it disables the "fail-fast" feature totally, ignoring even plugin [configurations by test](#configuration-by-test).

#### Examples

```bash
CYPRESS_FAIL_FAST_PLUGIN=false npm run cypress
```

or set the "env" key in the `cypress.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "env":
  {
    "FAIL_FAST_ENABLED": false
  }
}
```


### Configuration by test

If you want to configure the plugin on a specific test, you can set this by using the `failFast` property in [test configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Test-Configuration). The plugin allows next config values:

* __`failFast`__: Configuration for the plugin, containing any of next properties:
  * __`enabled`__ : Indicates wheter a failure of the current test or children tests _(if configuration is [applied to a suite](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Suite-configuration))_ should produce to skip the rest of tests or not. Note that the value defined in this property has priority over the value of the environment variable `CYPRESS_FAIL_FAST_ENABLED` _(but not over `CYPRESS_FAIL_FAST_PLUGIN`, which disables the plugin totally)_.


#### Example

In the next example, tests are configured to "fail-fast" only in case the test with the "sanity test" description fails. If any of the other tests fails, "fail-fast" will not be applied.

```js
describe("All tests", {
  failFast: {
    enabled: false, // Children tests and describes will inherit this configuration
  },
}, () => {
  it("sanity test", {
    failFast: {
      enabled: true, // Overwrite configuration defined in parents
    },
  }, () => {
    // Will skip the rest of tests if this one fails
    expect(true).to.be.true;
  });

  it("second test",() => {
    // Will continue executing tests if this one fails
    expect(true).to.be.true;
  });
});
```

### Configuration examples for usual scenarios

##### You want to disable "fail-fast" in all specs except one:

Set the `FAIL_FAST_ENABLED` key in the `cypress.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "env":
  {
    "FAIL_FAST_ENABLED": false
  }
}
```

Enable "fail-fast" in those specs you want using [configurations by test](#configuration-by-test):

```js
describe("All tests", { failFast: { enabled: true } }, () => {
  // If any test in this describe fails, the rest of tests and specs will be skipped
});
```

##### You want to totally disable "fail-fast" in your local environment:

Set the `FAIL_FAST_PLUGIN` key in your local `cypress.env.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "env":
  {
    "FAIL_FAST_PLUGIN": false
  }
}
```


## Usage with TypeScript

If you are using [TypeScript in the Cypress plugins file][cypress-typescript], this plugin includes TypeScript declarations and can be imported like the following:

```ts
import cypressFailFast = require("cypress-fail-fast/plugin");

export default (on: Cypress.PluginEvents, config: Cypress.PluginConfigOptions): Cypress.PluginConfigOptions => {
  cypressFailFast(on, config);
  return config;
};
```

## Tests

To ensure the plugin stability, it is being tested with Cypress major versions 5.x and 6.x, and new releases will be published for each new Cypress minor or major releases, updating the package E2E tests.

Latest versions used in the E2E tests can be checked in the `devDependencies` of the `package.json` files of the E2E tests:
* [Cypress v5](https://github.com/javierbrea/cypress-fail-fast/blob/main/test-e2e/cypress-variants/cypress-5/package.json)
* [Cypress v6](https://github.com/javierbrea/cypress-fail-fast/blob/main/test-e2e/cypress-variants/cypress-6/package.json)

Anyway, if you find any issue for a specific Cypress version, please report it at https://github.com/javierbrea/cypress-fail-fast/issues.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin has been developed based on the solutions proposed by the community on this [Cypress issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/518), so thanks to all! I hope this plugin can be deprecated soon, as soon as the Cypress team adds native support for this feature. ðŸ˜ƒ
